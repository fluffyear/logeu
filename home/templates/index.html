    <h1>Logeu!</h1>
    <p>Logeu is a learning tool which tests your Ancient Greek grammar and vocabulary. As of now, it works only with irregular verb vocabulary and some noun endings: it's still an early prototype with more features to come. If you have any queries or spot a bug, please contact me at loguequeries@gmail.com or via Discord, at CEO of meow#0360.</p>
